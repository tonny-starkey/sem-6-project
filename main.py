                        Sanitation:
                        
Rake and remove fallen leaves in autumn to reduce overwintering spores. Do not compost infected leaves in home compost piles. ¬† 
Prune trees to improve air circulation, which helps leaves dry faster.
                        

                        Resistant Cultivars:
                        
Plant apple varieties bred for scab resistance. This is the best long term solution. ¬† 
Proper watering:
Water in the morning or early evening so that foliage has time to dry, also try and avoid overhead watering that keeps the foliage wet for extended periods of time.

                        Chemical Control (Fungicides):
                        

Fungicides are most effective when applied preventively, before infection occurs. ¬† 

                        Timing is crucial:

"Protectant" fungicides, and "post infection" fungicides are the two main types.

                        Types of fungicides:

Always follow product label directions.

The fungus overwinters in cankers and mummified fruit.
Spores spread through wind and rain.
Infections occur through wounds or natural openings.

Effective management involves a combination of cultural practices and, in some cases, fungicide applications.


                  Cultural Control:

                  Sanitation:
Remove and destroy mummified fruit, fallen leaves, and infected branches.
Prune out cankers during dry weather.

                  Pruning:
Improve air circulation to reduce moisture.
Prune during dormant periods.

                  Tree Health:
Maintain tree vigor through proper watering and fertilization.
Reduce tree stress.

                  Chemical Control (Fungicides):
Fungicides are most effective when applied preventatively.
Consider fungicide use after cultural controls have been implemented, and the disease is still a problem.
Fungicides such as captan, and copper based fungicides can be used. Always follow the product label.
It is important to note that fungicides applied for apple scab control, can also help to control black rot.

Brown, globular galls form on branches.
In spring, these galls produce orange, gelatinous "horns" that release spores.

Remove galls from cedar trees before they release spores in spring.
Prune infected branches from apple trees.

Promote good air circulation by proper pruning and training of vines.
This helps leaves and fruit dry quickly, reducing the risk of infection.

                  Site Selection:
Plant grapevines in sunny locations with good air drainage.

"Tiger-stripe" patterns on leaves, with yellow or reddish discoloration between veins, which later become necrotic.

Dark, discolored wood in cross-sections of trunks, canes, and spurs.
"White rot" and "brown wood streaking" within the vine's wood.
apoplexy, which is a sudden collapse of the vine.

Esca is notoriously difficult to control, and there's no single cure. Management focuses on prevention and minimizing spread:


                  Preventive Measures:

                  Pruning Practices:
Delay pruning to reduce wound susceptibility.
Avoid pruning during wet periods.
Sterilize pruning tools to prevent disease spread.
Protect pruning wounds with wound protectants.

                  Vineyard Hygiene:
Remove and destroy infected wood.
Maintain healthy vineyard conditions to reduce stress on vines.

                  Planting Material:
Use healthy, disease-free planting material.

                  Resistant Varieties:
Research is ongoing into grape varieties with increased resistance.

                  Limited Chemical Control:
Fungicides are generally ineffective against established Esca infections.
Some wound protectants can help prevent new infections.

                  Biological Control:
Some applications of Trichoderma have shown promise in reducing infections.
