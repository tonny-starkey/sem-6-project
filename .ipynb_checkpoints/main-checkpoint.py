About Dataset
This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset. The original dataset can be found on this github repo. This dataset consists of about 87K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes. The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure. A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purpose.
Content
1. Train (70295 images)
2. Valid (17572 image)
3. Test (33 images)
               
The future of crop disease detection systems is very promising, with advancements in technology driving significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility. Here are some key areas of future scope:

1. Enhanced AI and Deep Learning:

Hybrid Models:
               
Combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Vision Transformers (ViTs) to leverage the strengths of both, leading to more accurate and robust disease detection.
Improved Accuracy:
Continued refinement of deep learning algorithms to achieve higher accuracy in detecting subtle disease symptoms and differentiating between similar diseases.
Predictive Analytics:
Developing AI models that can predict disease outbreaks based on environmental factors, historical data, and other relevant information.
               
2. Integration of Advanced Technologies:

Edge AI and IoT:
               
Deploying lightweight AI models on IoT devices for real-time disease detection in the field, especially in remote areas with limited internet connectivity.
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs/Drones):
               
Utilizing drones equipped with high-resolution cameras and sensors to capture aerial imagery for large-scale crop monitoring and early disease detection.
    
             Multi-modal Data Fusion:
               
Combining data from various sources, such as visible light, infrared, hyperspectral, and thermal imaging, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of plant health.
Sensor Technology:
               
The use of advanced sensors that can detect volatile organic compounds(VOC's) that plants release when under stress from disease. This would allow for even earlier detection of disease.
    
3. Data and Accessibility:

Federated Learning:
               
Enabling collaborative model training on decentralized datasets, ensuring data privacy and security.
Crowdsourced Data Collection:
               
Utilizing mobile apps to collect images and data from farmers, creating large-scale datasets for model training.
Accessibility for Farmers:
               
Developing user-friendly mobile apps and platforms that provide farmers with real-time disease detection and management recommendations.
    
4. Sustainable Agriculture:

    
Precision Agriculture:
               
Integrating disease detection systems into precision agriculture practices to optimize resource utilization and minimize environmental impact.
    
Early Intervention:

Enabling early disease detection and intervention to reduce crop losses and promote sustainable farming practices.
In essence, the future of crop disease detection systems is geared towards creating more intelligent, efficient, and accessible solutions that empower farmers to protect their crops and ensure food security.
